/* Approved deviations from the mockup (tasks.md SPA 1 and 2).
 *
 * A page task that exceeds the parity tolerance lists each exceeding chunk or text difference in
 * its report with the reason (a founder decision after Gate A, a corrected defect, the D044
 * screenshot edits, a resolved placeholder). Only the main session adds a row here, after it has
 * accepted that reason; every row names the decision or review that approved it. The specs print
 * every deviation they apply, so none is silent.
